# Currency Tracker

Currency Tracker is a web application built using React that allows users to keep track of the latest currency exchange rates. With the ability to select from a variety of currencies, users can easily monitor the value of their preferred currency in real-time. The application also features a historical chart that displays the currency's performance over time, allowing users to analyze trends and make informed decisions. Additionally, it includes the possibility to create a chart for a different number of days or select a specific time period using the date picker calendar. On the 'Bank' page, you can find all banks near you and filter them by currency.
